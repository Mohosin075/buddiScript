# Contributing to BuddiScript Frontend

Thank you for your interest in contributing to BuddiScript! Please read through this guide before contributing.

## How to contribute

1. Fork the repository and create a new feature branch from `main`.
2. Make your changes in the feature branch.
3. Keep commits small and focused; write meaningful commit messages.
4. Run linters and tests locally before submitting a PR.
5. Open a pull request with a clear description of your change and any context required.

## Branching & PRs

- Keep `main` protected and stable.
- Use feature branches named like `feature/<feature-name>`, `fix/<issue-number>`, or `chore/<description>`.
- PRs should be titled clearly and reference issues if relevant.

## Code style

- TypeScript + React patterns are followed.
- Use `eslint` and `prettier` for code formatting. Run `npm run lint` and `npm run format`.

## Commits

- Use conventional commit style (recommended):
  - feat: Add new function or feature
  - fix: Bug fix
  - docs: Documentation only changes
  - style: Format, missing semi-colons, etc.
  - refactor: Code change that neither fixes bug nor adds feature

## Tests & Linting

- Make sure to run and pass linting.
- If adding features, include tests for them.

## Reporting bugs

- File an issue in the tracker with a clear reproduction and the expected behavior.
